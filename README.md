 ## NYC to Des Moines Bike Share Analysis
 ### Project Overview:
 ---This analysis shows the relationship between total users, gender, days of the week versus trip duration for the bike-sharing program in New York City. By taking this sample analysis a determination can be made for the viability to start a bike-sharing program in the city of Des Moines.
 ### Results:
 ---The first results show the Users vs. Trip duration where we discover a large number of bikes are checked out for a 5 minute duration peaking around approximately 146,543 as shown in the following visualization ![User_vs_Trip](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/users_vs_tripduration.PNG)
 ---A comparison is then made to show bike times per checkout by gender which reveals a large difference in male riders vs others ![Trip_Duration_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/tripduration_by_gender.PNG)
 ---There is a deeper dive to find the time of day bikes are checkout out ![Trip_Times_Weekly](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trip_times_weekly.PNG)
 ---Again the weekly trip times are sliced further by gender ![Trip_Times_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trip_times_by_gender.PNG)
 ---The final comparison displays the type of users and their gender, based on subscribed and unsubscribed to the bikesharing program labeled as simply "customers" ![Subscriber_Weekly_by_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/usertrips_by_gender_weekly.PNG)
---Additional info was taken to get an idea of location where bike rides are initiated ![Top_Starting_Location](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/top_starting_location.PNG)
---A dashboard was created to summarize the most relevant data for reference in addition to the project story that will be presented to the primary stakeholders ![Bike_Sharing_Dashboard](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/bike_sharing_dashboard.PNG)

### Summary:
---After reviewing the data and doing a deep dive analysis, there is a plausible case to have a bikesharing business in any major city, due to the likelihood that a large number of people working in the city will live within 10-30 minute bike ride of the city. The first visualization that would be suggested is data specific to Des Moines residents within 10-25 minute bike riding distance along with a survey to gauge interest. The second major visualization that would prove useful is analysis on general locatino the non-subscribed riders live (i.e. rural vs. urban). The initial data [Subscriber_Weekly_by_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/usertrips_by_gender_weekly.PNG) suggest that customers are taking most of the trips on the weekend for lesiure. This could be because users are not fully commited to using bikesharing regularly or they could live in rural areas making it to far to bike ride.
