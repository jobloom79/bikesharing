 ## NYC to Des Moines Bike Share Analysis
 ### Project Overview:
 ---This analysis shows the relationship between total users, gender, days of the week versus trip duration for the bike-sharing program in New York City. By taking this sample analysis a determination can be made for the viability to start a bike-sharing program in the city of Des Moines.
 ### Results:
 ---The first results show the Users vs. Trip duration where we discover a large number of bikes are checked out for a 5 minute duration peaking around approximately 146,543 as shown in the following visualization ![User_vs_Trip](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/users_vs_tripduration.PNG) ![Trip_Duration_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/tripduration_by_gender.PNG)
 ---A comparison is then made to show bike times per checkout by gender which reveals a large difference in male riders vs others 
 ---There is a deeper dive to find the time of day bikes are checkout out ![Trip_Times_Weekly](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trip_times_weekly.PNG)
 ---Again the weekly trip times are sliced further by gender ![Trip_Times_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trip_times_by_gender.PNG)
 ---The final comparison displays the type of users and their gender, based on subscribed and unsubscribed to the bikesharing program labeled as simply "customers" ![Subscriber_Weekly_by_Gender](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/usertrips_by_gender_weekly.PNG)
---Additional info was taken to get an idea of location where bike rides are initiated ![Top_Starting_Location](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/top_starting_location.PNG)
---A dashboard was created to summarize the most relevant data for reference in addition to the project story that will be presented to the primary stakeholders ![Bike_Sharing_Dashboard](https://github.com/jobloom79/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/bike_sharing_dashboard.PNG)
